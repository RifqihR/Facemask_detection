# Facemask_detection
Facemask detection using jetson nano 2gb, Yolov3-tiny, Mg90 servo motor, and PCA9685 servo drive.

you need python3.7 to run adafruit servo kit library. in my case, i use virtual environment wiht pytho3.7 then run control_servo.py with it.
at the same time i run facemask detection code with python3.6
